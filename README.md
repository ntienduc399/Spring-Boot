This project is a Spring Boot application that provides a RESTful API for managing users. 
It includes a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for user data. 
The project uses tests ensuring that the API endpoints work correctly by validating HTTP requests and responses. 
The tests cover all major operations such as retrieving all users, fetching individual users by ID, adding new users, updating existing users, and deleting users. 
The API follows REST principles and is designed to be easily extensible and scalable.
